    Fetch Statcast pitch-by-pitch data for MLB regular-season (or other game_type) games

    Parameters
    ----------
    start_year : int
        First season to include (inclusive).
    end_year : int
        Last season to include (inclusive).
    columns : Sequence[str] | None
        Columns to keep. If None, uses a default set tailored for your Markov chain work.
    game_type : str
        MLB game type code, default 'R' (regular season). Others: 'S' (spring), 'E' (exhib), 'F' (wild card),
        'D' (Division), 'L' (LCS), 'W' (World Series), etc.
    use_cache : bool
        Enable pybaseball cache to speed up repeated calls.
    show_progress : bool
        Print year/month progress while fetching.
